/*
 * received messages are anything received from the network and put into the program.
 * they have four types, Normal, Me, Notify, and Here
 * Normal is a standard broadcast and should be displayed normally
 * Me are for /me broadcasts
 * Notify are for incoming notifications
 * Here messages are for the periodic broadcasts the antenna sends when the user is inactive.  They don't need channel or contents and should not be displayed.
 * Who Here messages are sent by other users trying to know who's in the channel.
