Welcome to Lirch!

Chat in the Lirch IRC channel #Lirch.

Lirch uses the BSD license, so it is open-source software.
(See ./LICENSE and ./CONTRIBUTORS.)

To build Lirch, either use qmake (messy, less configurable):
$ qmake lirch.pro && make

Or preferably, use the CMake build process:
(This is better for developers, since it keeps the source tree clean.)
1) Create a directory to perform the build.
(../lirch-build is a good choice. We will use this in our example.)
2) Navigate to this directory
(We assume the repo is cloned to ../lirch-source; adjust accordingly.)
3) Point cmake to the directory containing CMakeLists.txt
(We will use the ncurses interface to cmake, ccmake.)
$ ccmake ../lirch-source
4) Use the keyboard to customize the build process.
5) Press [c] to configure, [g] to generate, then:
$ make
